---------- ROBOT TO-DO ----------
SOFTWARE
- Make motors move:
	- turn right/left
	- go straight (account for drift)
- Create turning algorithm 
- Implement sensors (photosensors, distance sensor) into the code 


PHYSICAL CAR
- H-bridge implementation to breadboard and car
- Placement of sensors on car
- Placement of Arduino onto car (3-D print mount? Make own from scratch?)


EXTRA 
- Christmas lights?
- Music/sound coming from car? 



---------- BASIC CAR ALGORITHM + NOTES ----------
analogRead: reads analog data (read voltage values)
digitalRead: reads digital data (1/0)
pinMode: set pins to either input/output

Power (turn on/off robot):
	use digitalRead:
		detect if button is pressed

Obtaining sensor data: 
	!!!!!!!DEFINE WHICH PINS WILL BE USED FOR OUTPUT/INPUT FIRST (standardize so collaboration on coding is simpler)!!!!!!!!
	use analog data to control motor on car to change directions, etc.  
		
		use distance sensor to detect obstacles/walls 
			calculate some threshold value to stop car 

		use photoresistor to detect black/white
			calculate some threshold value that the sensor detects black/white
			determine when mvmt of car at this threshold 

!!!!be careful which pins are set output and input!!!!
	some pins on Arduino are meant for certain purposes and not free for use (SERIOUSLY CHECK THE BOARD SCHEMATIC, BURNING OUT PINS IS PAINFUL)
